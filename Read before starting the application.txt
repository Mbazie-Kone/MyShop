Anyone who modifies the entrypoint.sh file must run this command (only once on the new version) using Git Bash in the root of the project before starting the application with the command docker-compose up --build -d.
If you haven't made any changes to this file, simply start the application.

dos2unix ./initdb/entrypoint.sh
chmod +x ./initdb/entrypoint.sh
